#Coding Challenge - Shopping Basket Task  

You have been asked to model a shopping basket.  

**We must be able to:**
 
* Add items to the shopping basket  
* Remove items from the shopping basket  
* Empty the shopping basket  

Additionally, we must be able to calculate the total value of the shopping basket accounting for:  

* Buy-one-get-one-free discounts on items  
* 10% off on totals greater than £20 (after bogof)  
* 2% off on total (after all other discounts) for customers with loyalty cards.  

We must be able to see the code running via passing tests or Terminal output.  

**What we will be looking for:**  
Evidence of using a statically typed programming language and solid coding techniques with evidence of test driven development.
